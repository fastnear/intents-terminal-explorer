# Ratacat Project Summary

## What We Built
**Ratacat** is a keyboard-driven terminal todo list application built in Rust using Ratatui and SQLite. We transformed an existing NEAR dashboard template into a fully-featured task management system.

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Complete Architecture Transformation
- Started with: A simple 3-pane dashboard showing blockchain data
- Transformed to: A sophisticated todo management system
- Maintained the clean separation of concerns from the original

### 2. Data Persistence Layer
- Implemented full SQLite integration with proper schema design
- Created efficient queries for projects and todos
- Added support for tags, priorities, and due dates
- Automatic database initialization with default project

### 3. Advanced UI Features
- Modal popups for quick actions (add, edit, confirm)
- Real-time search and filtering
- Visual priority indicators and progress bars
- Smart sorting with multiple modes
- Responsive keyboard navigation

### 4. State Management
- Centralized state management in App struct
- Undo/redo system with action history
- Efficient filtering and sorting algorithms
- Proper handling of edge cases (empty lists, bounds checking)

## Technical Challenges Overcome

1. **Rust Borrow Checker**: Worked around complex borrowing scenarios by using indices and strategic cloning
2. **UI Responsiveness**: Implemented frame-rate control and efficient rendering
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensured proper synchronization between UI state and database

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500 (excluding dependencies)
- **Compilation Warnings**: 6 minor warnings (unused code for future features)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between models, storage, app logic, and UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with room for improvement

## Running the Application

```bash
# Build and run
cargo run

# Or use the convenience script
./run.sh

# With custom FPS
RENDER_FPS=60 cargo run
```
